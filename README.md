# MK64Bot
very basic node.js discord bot that replies with pong when pinged with: "ping"

I did not upload the "node_modules" folder, as it contained too many files for me to upload. I didn't write any code in there anyway, pretty sure it only just contains the discord modules that you can download on your own
